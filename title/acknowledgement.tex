I am thankful to \workPruefer for giving me the opportunity to work on this interesting topic as well as for introducing me to this theme and the interesting discussions.


Also I am grateful to Prof. Dr. Uwe Manthe, Nils Wittenbrink and the whole theoretical chemistry work group for the nice atmosphere and the helpful discussions.


And last but not least I want to thank my family and friends for supporting me during my studies.
